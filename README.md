# SEG3125: Analysis and  Design of User Interfaces 

I contributed to this project with two assignments: a website for a tennis centre and a trip planning AI chatbot.

## Ace Tennis Centre
A website for a tennis centre, designed to practice understanding different user needs, iterative design practices involving peer evaluation, and creating mockups using Figma. 

The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ace895/Ace_Tennis_Center) and the website is hosted [here](https://ace895.github.io/Ace_Tennis_Center/index.html).


## Tripper AI Chatbot

An AI chatbot capable of helping the user plan a trip. The focus of this project was incorporating accessibility, internationalization, user control, personalization, and visual feedback features to enhance user experience. We used Gradio to build the UI and Groq to implement the LLM.
